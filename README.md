# RequireWhat

A Chrome extension that tells you what a website's password requirements are so you don't have to guess

## Site configuration

This extension uses a large collection of handwritten config files to define the password rules for each website. These can be found in the src/sites/ directory of this repository.

### Example

Here is a barebones basic configuration for an example website:

```json
{
    "name": "Example Site",
    "domains": [
        "example.com",
        "*.example.com"
    ],
    "links": {
        "login": "https://example.com/login",
        "logout": "https://example.com/logout",
        "register": "https://example.com/register",
        "change_password": "https://example.com/change_password",
        "reset_password": "https://example.com/reset_password"
    },
    "password_rules": [
        {
            "@type": "length",
            "@rule": "allow",
            "min": 10,
            "max": 20
        },
        {
            "@type": "zxcvbn",
            "@rule": "allow",
            "score_min": 3
        },
        {
            "@type": "personal",
            "@rule": "deny",
            "types": [
                "email",
                "username"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example config, the site example.com requires:

* Passwords be between 10 and 20 characters (inclusive)
* Passwords must get a [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) score of 3 or greater.
* Passwords must not be the user's email or username.

### Fields

At the root level of the JSON object, you must have these keys:

* `name`: A user-displayable name for the config.
* `domains`: An array of domain names this config applies to. Wildcards can be indicated with asterisks (\*)
* `password_rules`: An ordered array of rules that apply to this site's passwords. Each rule should have the following keys:
  * `@type`: The rule type as a string. See the below section "Password rule types" for possible values.
  * `@rule`: "require" or "deny"
  * any additional options relevant to the rule type
